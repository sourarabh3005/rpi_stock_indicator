Raspberry Pi Based Long-Term Capital Gain Indicator


The Raspberry Pi Based Long-Term Capital Gain Indicator is a smart stock market monitoring system designed to continuously track stock prices, providing real-time visual and auditory alerts based on stock conditions. Unlike traditional stock market apps that rely on smartphone notifications, this project integrates hardware components (an RGB LED and a speaker) to deliver instant and unmissable alerts. The system fetches data from an Excel sheet stored on Google Drive and monitors stock prices 24x7 throughout the year.
